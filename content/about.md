I'm interested in the intersection of technology and human rights. After 7 years working with governments around the world to prevent genocide, I'm looking to expand my technical skills and experience in the digital world.

This blog will document my path learning more about cybersecurity topics. If you're interested in saying hi, [send me an email](mailto:hi@robinscharf.me)!
