I'm interested in a *lot* of topics, such as **the intersection of technology and human rights**, **open-soruce, home automation, and data ownership**, and **diplomacy, conflict, and internet freedoms**. After 7 years working with governments around the world to prevent genocide and other mass atrocities, I'm looking to expand my skills and experience in the digital world.

This blog will document my activities, principally learning more about cybersecurity topics. If you're interested in saying hi, [send me an email](mailto:hi@robinscharf.me)!
