I am happy to share that I recently passed the the Penetration Testing with Kali Linux certification exam on May 10!

## The Exam
According to [OffSec's website](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/):

> The industry-leading Penetration Testing with Kali Linux (PWK/PEN-200) course introduces penetration testing methodologies, tools and techniques via hands-on experience and is self-paced. Learners who complete the course and pass the exam will earn the OffSec Certified Professional (OSCP) certification which requires holders to successfully attack and penetrate various live machines in a safe lab environment. The OSCP is considered to be more technical than other ethical hacking certifications and is one of the few that requires evidence of practical penetration testing skills.

## My Experience

### Preparation
Between [finishing the PNPT](http://localhost:1313/blog/november-28/) and beginning OffSec's PEN200 course, I completed 20 HackTheBox entries from TJNull's famous list. If you find that you're struggling with boxes from the list, I highly recommend taking a look at [IppSec's OSCP Prep playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLidcsTyj9JXK-fnabFLVEvHinQ14Jy5tf), which covers dozens of boxes included in the list. 

In addition to the aforementioned boxes, I participated in HTB's Open Beta Season as part of the [DevotedOccultists](https://app.hackthebox.com/teams/overview/5487) team.

### PEN200 - Course
Due to the timing of my PEN200 adventure, I had the unique experience of following both the "2022" and "2023" version of the course. In case you are unfamiliar, in mid-March of 2023, OffSec (formerly Offensive Security) [released an updated version of the PEN200 course](https://www.offsec.com/offsec/pen-200-2023/) - the first in approximately three years.
