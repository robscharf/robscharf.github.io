      <description>About Instead of a single box write-up, I am including walkthroughs for three easy rated, retired Windows HackTheBox machines here to kick off my pursuit of completing the infamous TJNull list of OSCP prep-relevant machines across the popular CTF and training platforms. The recently updated list can be found here. Due to the simplicity of the machines, these writeups are presented with concision in mind, unlike the majority of my other walkthroughs.</description>

      <description>About Brute is a medium rated CTF room on TryHackMe. Rooting this box - which centers around brute-force attacks, as its name implies - involves carrying out a successful dictionary attacks, database enumeration, log poisoning, hash cracking, and cronjob-based privilege escalation. Note: I have replaced all instances of the virtual machine&amp;rsquo;s ip address with &amp;lt;target-ip&amp;gt; throughout this write-up.

      <description>About Daily Bugle is a hard rated CTF room on TryHackMe. Rooting this box involves carrying out a successful CMS enumeration, SQLi, hash cracking, and binary-based privilege escalation.
Note: I have replaced all instances of the virtual machine&amp;rsquo;s ip address with &amp;lt;target-ip&amp;gt; throughout this write-up.
Enumeration nmap Nmap scan report for &amp;lt;target-ip&amp;gt; Host is up, received user-set (0.10s latency). Scanned at 2022-06-16 15:11:23 EDT for 549s Not shown: 65521 closed tcp ports (conn-refused) PORT STATE SERVICE REASON VERSION 22/tcp open ssh syn-ack OpenSSH 7.</description>

      <title>THM: Biblioteca -- Write-Up</title>
      <link>https://robscharf.github.io/posts/2022/07/thm-biblioteca--write-up/</link>

      <guid>https://robscharf.github.io/posts/2022/07/thm-biblioteca--write-up/</guid>
      <description>About Biblioteca is a medium rated CTF room on TryHackMe. Rooting this box involves carrying out a successful SQL injection to obtain a foothold, identifying an opportunity for a &amp;ldquo;lateral privilege escalation&amp;rdquo; via brute-force attack, and further escalation to root via Python library hijacking.
Note: I have replaced all instances of the virtual machine&amp;rsquo;s ip address with &amp;lt;target-ip&amp;gt; throughout this write-up.
Enumeration nmap I began by running a standard nmap scan against the target host.</description>

      <title>THM: Agent Sudo -- Write-Up</title>
      <link>https://robscharf.github.io/posts/2022/05/thm-agent-sudo--write-up/</link>

      <guid>https://robscharf.github.io/posts/2022/05/thm-agent-sudo--write-up/</guid>
      <description>About TryHackMe.com&amp;rsquo;s Agent Sudo is a beginner-friendly capture-the-flag virtual machine by DesKel. Agent Sudo has a secret agent theme and challenges users to capture two flags and gain root access by locating and decrypting a series of confidential communications.
Note I have replaced all instances of the virtual machine&amp;rsquo;s ip address with &amp;lt;target-ip&amp;gt; throughout this write-up.
Methodology We begin our enumeration efforts by running an nmap scan on the target machine to understand the ports that are open to network traffic.</description>

      <description>About TryHackMe.com&amp;rsquo;s Mr Robot CTF (MRCTF) is a beginner-friendly capture-the-flag virtual machine by Leon Johnson. MRCTF is named after, and inspired by, the Mr. Robot television show and challenges users to capture three flags by finding vulnerabilities in the target server and exploiting them to gain root access.
Note I have replaced all instances of the virtual machine&amp;rsquo;s ip address with &amp;lt;target-ip&amp;gt; throughout this write-up.
