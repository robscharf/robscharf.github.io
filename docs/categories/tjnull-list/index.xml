      <description>About This is the second installment of walkthroughs for three easy rated, retired HackTheBox machines. I am currently making my way through Offensive Security&amp;rsquo;s PEN-200 course, with plans to take the OSCP exam later this year. As part of my preparations, I am working on the infamous TJNull list of OSCP prep-relevant machines across the popular CTF and training platforms. The list can be found here.
At this moment, I have completed 17 HTB machines from the TJNull list and I am approximately 30% of the way through PEN-200, with all course exercises finished for the first 10 sections of the course.</description>

      <description>About Instead of a single box write-up, I am including walkthroughs for three easy rated, retired Windows HackTheBox machines here to kick off my pursuit of completing the infamous TJNull list of OSCP prep-relevant machines across the popular CTF and training platforms. The recently updated list can be found here. Due to the simplicity of the machines, these writeups are presented with concision in mind, unlike the majority of my other walkthroughs.</description>
