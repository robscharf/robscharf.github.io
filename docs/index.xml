      <description>About Instead of a single box write-up, I am including walkthroughs for three easy rated, retired Windows HackTheBox machines here to kick off my pursuit of completing the infamous TJNull list of OSCP prep-relevant machines across the popular CTF and training platforms. The recently updated list can be found here. Due to the simplicity of the machines, these writeups are presented with concision in mind, unlike the majority of my other walkthroughs.</description>

      <description>About Daily Bugle is a hard rated CTF room on TryHackMe. Rooting this box involves carrying out a successful CMS enumeration, SQLi, hash cracking, and binary-based privilege escalation.
Note: I have replaced all instances of the virtual machine&amp;rsquo;s ip address with &amp;lt;target-ip&amp;gt; throughout this write-up.
Enumeration nmap Nmap scan report for &amp;lt;target-ip&amp;gt; Host is up, received user-set (0.10s latency). Scanned at 2022-06-16 15:11:23 EDT for 549s Not shown: 65521 closed tcp ports (conn-refused) PORT STATE SERVICE REASON VERSION 22/tcp open ssh syn-ack OpenSSH 7.</description>

      <title>THM: Biblioteca -- Write-Up</title>

      <description>About Biblioteca is a medium rated CTF room on TryHackMe. Rooting this box involves carrying out a successful SQL injection to obtain a foothold, identifying an opportunity for a &amp;ldquo;lateral privilege escalation&amp;rdquo; via brute-force attack, and further escalation to root via Python library hijacking.
Note: I have replaced all instances of the virtual machine&amp;rsquo;s ip address with &amp;lt;target-ip&amp;gt; throughout this write-up.
Enumeration nmap I began by running a standard nmap scan against the target host.</description>

      <description>About TryHackMe.com&amp;rsquo;s Agent Sudo is a beginner-friendly capture-the-flag virtual machine by DesKel. Agent Sudo has a secret agent theme and challenges users to capture two flags and gain root access by locating and decrypting a series of confidential communications.
Note I have replaced all instances of the virtual machine&amp;rsquo;s ip address with &amp;lt;target-ip&amp;gt; throughout this write-up.
Methodology We begin our enumeration efforts by running an nmap scan on the target machine to understand the ports that are open to network traffic.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my write-up of the Upload Vulnerabilities room on TryHackMe, created by MuirlandOracle. Let&amp;rsquo;s jump in.
Note: The Complete Beginner THM skill path is now considered depricated in favor of the Jr Penetration Tester path.
Task 1 - Getting Started The room begins with a necessary configuration step. The hosts file of the attacking machine needs to be modified to include the following line:
&amp;lt;machine-ip&amp;gt; overwrite.uploadvulns.thm shell.uploadvulns.thm java.uploadvulns.thm annex.uploadvulns.thm magic.</description>
