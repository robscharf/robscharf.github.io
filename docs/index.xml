      <description>Lately I have been really enjoying Obsidian as a personal knowledge base. It uses simple Markdown files, which makes maintaining synchronized cross-platform access easy and low impact.
The problem I recently ran into a small problem when I decided to change my workflow to run Obsidian on my Windows PC host machine, instead of inside my Kali or Ubuntu virtual machines. Until now, I have largely been running Obsidian on my Macbook and inside my working machines on my PC.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my write-up of the Upload Vulnerabilities room on TryHackMe, created by MuirlandOracle. Let&amp;rsquo;s jump in.
Task 1 - Getting Started The room begins with a necessary configuration step. The hosts file of the attacking machine needs to be modified to include the following line:
&amp;lt;machine-ip&amp;gt; overwrite.uploadvulns.thm shell.uploadvulns.thm java.uploadvulns.thm annex.uploadvulns.thm magic.uploadvulns.thm jewel.uploadvulns.thm demo.uploadvulns.thm
Note: You will require administrator-level privileges when editing the file. This can be done via sudo on Linux and Run as Administrator on Windows.</description>

      <description>Wrapping up my intro to the Juice Shop Today I finished up the OWASP Juice Shop Room on THM, after leaving the final Cross-site Scripting (XSS) modules unfinished last week. This involved quick introductory examples of three XSS modalities:
   DOM Persistent (Server-side) Reflected (Client-side)     DOM XSS uses the HTML environment to execute malicious JavaScript. This type of attack commonly uses the &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; HTML tag.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m interested in a lot of topics, such as the intersection of technology and human rights, open-source, home automation, and data ownership, and diplomacy, conflict, and internet freedoms. After 7 years working with governments around the world to prevent genocide and other mass atrocities, I&amp;rsquo;m looking to expand my skills and experience in the digital world.
This blog will document my activities, principally learning more about cybersecurity topics. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in saying hi, send me an email!</description>
