      <description>Wrapping up my intro to the Juice Shop Today I finished up the OWASP Juice Shop Room on THM, after leaving the final Cross-site Scripting (XSS) modules unfinished last week. This involved quick introductory examples of three XSS modalities:
   DOM Persistent (Server-side) Reflected (Client-side)     DOM XSS uses the HTML environment to execute malicious JavaScript. This type of attack commonly uses the &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; HTML tag.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m interested in a lot of topics, such as the intersection of technology and human rights, open-soruce, home automation, and data ownership, and diplomacy, conflict, and internet freedoms. After 7 years working with governments around the world to prevent genocide, I&amp;rsquo;m looking to expand my skills and experience in the digital world.
This blog will document my activities, principally learning more about cybersecurity topics. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in saying hi, send me an email!</description>
