      <description>About TryHackMe.com&amp;rsquo;s Agent Sudo is a beginner-friendly capture-the-flag virtual machine by DesKel. Agent Sudo has a secret agent theme and challenges users to capture two flags and gain root access by locating and decrypting a series of confidential communications.
Note I have replaced all instances of the virtual machine&amp;rsquo;s ip address with &amp;lt;target-ip&amp;gt; throughout this write-up.
Methodology We begin our enumeration efforts by running an nmap scan on the target machine to understand the ports that are open to network traffic.</description>

      <description>About TryHackMe.com&amp;rsquo;s Mr Robot CTF (MRCTF) is a beginner-friendly capture-the-flag virtual machine by Leon Johnson. MRCTF is named after, and inspired by, the Mr. Robot television show and challenges users to capture three flags by finding vulnerabilities in the target server and exploiting them to gain root access.
Note I have replaced all instances of the virtual machine&amp;rsquo;s ip address with &amp;lt;target-ip&amp;gt; throughout this write-up.

      <description>Lately I have been really enjoying Obsidian as a personal knowledge base. It uses simple Markdown files, which makes maintaining synchronized cross-platform access easy and low impact.
The problem I recently ran into a small problem when I decided to change my workflow to run Obsidian on my Windows PC host machine, instead of inside my Kali or Ubuntu virtual machines. Until now, I have largely been running Obsidian on my Macbook and inside my working machines on my PC.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my write-up of the Upload Vulnerabilities room on TryHackMe, created by MuirlandOracle. Let&amp;rsquo;s jump in.
Note: The Complete Beginner THM skill path is now considered depricated in favor of the Jr Penetration Tester path.
Task 1 - Getting Started The room begins with a necessary configuration step. The hosts file of the attacking machine needs to be modified to include the following line:
&amp;lt;machine-ip&amp;gt; overwrite.uploadvulns.thm shell.uploadvulns.thm java.uploadvulns.thm annex.uploadvulns.thm magic.</description>

      <description>Wrapping up my intro to the Juice Shop Today I finished up the OWASP Juice Shop Room on THM, after leaving the final Cross-site Scripting (XSS) modules unfinished last week. This involved quick introductory examples of three XSS modalities:
   DOM Persistent (Server-side) Reflected (Client-side)     DOM XSS uses the HTML environment to execute malicious JavaScript. This type of attack commonly uses the &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; HTML tag.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m interested in a lot of topics, such as the intersection of technology and human rights, open-source, home automation, and data ownership, and diplomacy, conflict, and internet freedoms. I have a B.A. in History from Northeastern University (&amp;lsquo;11) and an M.A. in The History of Warfare from King&amp;rsquo;s College London (&amp;lsquo;13). After 7 years working with governments around the world to prevent genocide and other mass atrocities, I&amp;rsquo;m looking to expand my skills and experience in the digital world.</description>
