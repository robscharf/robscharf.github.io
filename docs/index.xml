      <description>About Instead of a single box write-up, I am including walkthroughs for three easy rated, retired Windows HackTheBox machines here to kick off my pursuit of completing the infamous TJNull list of OSCP prep-relevant machines across the popular CTF and training platforms. The recently updated list can be found here. Due to the simplicity of the machines, these writeups presented with concision in mind, unlike the majority of my other walkthroughs.</description>

      <description>About Brute is a medium rated CTF room on TryHackMe. Rooting this box - which centers around brute-force attacks, as its name implies - involves carrying out a successful dictionary attacks, database enumeration, log poisoning, hash cracking, and cronjob-based privilege escalation. Note: I have replaced all instances of the virtual machine&amp;rsquo;s ip address with &amp;lt;target-ip&amp;gt; throughout this write-up.

      <description>About Daily Bugle is a hard rated CTF room on TryHackMe. Rooting this box involves carrying out a successful CMS enumeration, SQLi, hash cracking, and binary-based privilege escalation.
Note: I have replaced all instances of the virtual machine&amp;rsquo;s ip address with &amp;lt;target-ip&amp;gt; throughout this write-up.

      <guid>https://robscharf.github.io/posts/2022/07/thm-biblioteca--write-up/</guid>
      <description>About Biblioteca is a medium rated CTF room on TryHackMe. Rooting this box involves carrying out a successful SQL injection to obtain a foothold, identifying an opportunity for a &amp;ldquo;lateral privilege escalation&amp;rdquo; via brute-force attack, and further escalation to root via Python library hijacking.
Note: I have replaced all instances of the virtual machine&amp;rsquo;s ip address with &amp;lt;target-ip&amp;gt; throughout this write-up.
Enumeration nmap I began by running a standard nmap scan against the target host.</description>

      <description>I am pleased to share that I recently passed the eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester certification exam on June 16!
The Exam According to INE&amp;rsquo;s website:
The eJPT is a three day, 20 question exam, that focuses on challenging you to prove your skillset in penetration testing foundations including programming, networking vulnerabilities, web attack vectors, and a host of other entry level skills&amp;hellip; Covering a host of skills which include entry level web penetration techniques, the eJPT provides you with the confidence and knowledge to begin training for more advanced penetration techniques and specialities.</description>

      <description>About TryHackMe.com&amp;rsquo;s Agent Sudo is a beginner-friendly capture-the-flag virtual machine by DesKel. Agent Sudo has a secret agent theme and challenges users to capture two flags and gain root access by locating and decrypting a series of confidential communications.
Note I have replaced all instances of the virtual machine&amp;rsquo;s ip address with &amp;lt;target-ip&amp;gt; throughout this write-up.
Methodology We begin our enumeration efforts by running an nmap scan on the target machine to understand the ports that are open to network traffic.</description>

      <description>About TryHackMe.com&amp;rsquo;s Mr Robot CTF (MRCTF) is a beginner-friendly capture-the-flag virtual machine by Leon Johnson. MRCTF is named after, and inspired by, the Mr. Robot television show and challenges users to capture three flags by finding vulnerabilities in the target server and exploiting them to gain root access.
Note I have replaced all instances of the virtual machine&amp;rsquo;s ip address with &amp;lt;target-ip&amp;gt; throughout this write-up.

      <description>Lately I have been really enjoying Obsidian as a personal knowledge base. It uses simple Markdown files, which makes maintaining synchronized cross-platform access easy and low impact.
The problem I recently ran into a small problem when I decided to change my workflow to run Obsidian on my Windows PC host machine, instead of inside my Kali or Ubuntu virtual machines. Until now, I have largely been running Obsidian on my Macbook and inside my working machines on my PC.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my write-up of the Upload Vulnerabilities room on TryHackMe, created by MuirlandOracle. Let&amp;rsquo;s jump in.
Note: The Complete Beginner THM skill path is now considered depricated in favor of the Jr Penetration Tester path.
Task 1 - Getting Started The room begins with a necessary configuration step. The hosts file of the attacking machine needs to be modified to include the following line:
&amp;lt;machine-ip&amp;gt; overwrite.uploadvulns.thm shell.uploadvulns.thm java.uploadvulns.thm annex.uploadvulns.thm magic.</description>

      <description>Today I finished up the OWASP Juice Shop Room on THM, after leaving the final Cross-site Scripting (XSS) modules unfinished last week. This involved quick introductory examples of three XSS modalities:
DOM Persistent (Server-side) Reflected (Client-side) DOM XSS uses the HTML environment to execute malicious JavaScript. This type of attack commonly uses the &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; HTML tag. Persistent XSS is JavaScript that is run when the server loads the page containing it.</description>
